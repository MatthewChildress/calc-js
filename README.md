# calc-js

My attempt for a calculator project prompt from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">Odin Project</a> build with vanilla JavaScript and CSS. 

I'm still having a few issues getting the screen divs to stay static at height. I'm hoping to use '%' or ems to dictate height to help it scale when I make it mobile responsive.

Additionally, I'm still working on figuring out how to make the equals button continue to run functions for the math from last prompts.


Otherwise, it's fairly well finished. There's a lot of DOM manipulation throughout the JavaScript and a few simple equations. This was one of the first projects that I had to REALLY sit down and plan out how the functions were going to play with one another. Took me a few start from scratch goes to really understand where I wanted to go.

I'm hoping to go back and use the data-sets adequately when I spruce it up. I'd like to be more specific with what I'm doing with it.
